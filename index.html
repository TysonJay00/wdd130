            <p>I love to ski. Skiing is my favourite sport. I started when I was 9, and also took up snowboarding when I was 15. It feels like flying when you soar down the mountain, gliding off the powdered snow.</p>

            <p>I was born and raised in Alberta, Canada. Although it can get very cold during the winter, it is a very beautful country with our vast landscapes such as the breathtaking Rocky Mountains, Boreal Forests, and Grasslands to name a few. There are many lakes to swim in and to go boating. Canada has more lakes than any other country.</p>
